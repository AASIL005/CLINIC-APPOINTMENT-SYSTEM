Clinic Appointment Booking System

A simple, user-friendly web-based system to manage clinic appointments. Built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and C++ (OOP) for backend logic. This project demonstrates how to create a lightweight booking system suitable for small clinics or solo practitioners without using SQL or external APIs.

 Features
 Book appointment with Name, Date, and Description
 
 Date picker input for easy date selection

 Form validation for complete input before submission

 Logic handled using C++ classes (OOP principles)

 Fully responsive, clean, and modern UI using HTML & CSS
 Tech Stack
Frontend	Backend
HTML5	C++ (OOP)
CSS3	
JavaScript	


 Getting Started
 Run the Website:
Open index.html in your browser.

Fill in the form and click Submit.

 Run the C++ Backend:
Compile the appointment.cpp file:

bash
Copy code
g++ appointment.cpp -o appointment
Run the compiled file:

bash
Copy code
./appointment
Note: Backend interaction with frontend (form to C++) is simulated using basic logic or file handling, not connected via server-side integration.

 Future Scope
Integrate file-based appointment storage (.txt)

Add unique ID for each appointment

Use local storage (JS) or server integration

Extend to doctor login & schedule view

 UI Preview
Include a screenshot of your interface here (optional for GitHub uploads).
